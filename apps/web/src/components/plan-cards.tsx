      <details>
        <summary>How does the free trial work?</summary>
        <p>
          Eligible accounts can try Pro for {pricing.trial.days} days, with
          unlimited recipe storage and {pricing.trial.aiCredits} AI credits in
          total. Sign in, open Plan &amp; billing and start your trial. Review
          the payment and renewal terms at checkout, and cancel before renewal
          if you don't want to continue. Pro checkout must be available to start
          a trial.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is an AI credit?</summary>
        <p>
          One credit covers one attempt to import or generate a recipe with AI.
          Once AI processing starts, the credit is used even if the attempt
          fails. Typing or editing a recipe uses no credits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free credits are a one-time allowance. Paid Pro credits reset on the
          first of each month, UTC, and don't roll over. Deleting a recipe
          doesn't restore credits.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What happens if I cancel?</summary>
        <p>
          Your recipes stay readable, editable and exportable. When Pro ends,
          you return to Free. If you have {pricing.free.recipes} or more saved
          recipes, remove some or upgrade before adding another.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does everyone in my household need Pro?</summary>
        <p>
          No. Pro lets you create a household and invite others. Free members
          can join and contribute within their own recipe and AI allowances.
          Meal plans and shopping lists stay personal to each account.
